# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
- WAF can be added in front of the load balancer using the OWASP 10 rules (https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)
- By making sure that the S3 buckets have server side data encryption enabled.

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
- No, as we might need the IAM permissions to guard us against unauthorized access.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
- Enabling encryption does not affect the existing objects but any new files will all be encrypted.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
- Nothing will happen, it will just overwrite any prior changes made.
