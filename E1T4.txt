Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
> InstanceRolePolicy-C3:
- It allows access to all S3 buckets and all actions. 
- We should allow only read access to Free Recipe S3 bucket(for least privilege).
- For Secret recipe bucket we should enable encryption for security reason.


# Poor practice 2
- The Web Service instance is in the public subnet and its security group is exposes to all ports of IP addresses.
- The instance should be moved to a private subnet and security group should allow application load balancer only.
