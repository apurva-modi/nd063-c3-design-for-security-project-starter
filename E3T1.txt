# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack
> Based on the description of UnauthorizedAccess:EC2/SSHBruteForce,  
	- GuardDuty detect that an attacker is using brute force attack on port 22. 


# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.
> Based on the GuardDuty documentation, the CloudTrail event logs, VPC Flow Logs and DNS logs are used to detect an attack in the GuardDuty. 
	- It also uses Machine Learning techniques to detect an attack. 
	- For the attack performed in this exercise, AWS might have used VPC Flow logs to detect this attack as API calls were not used.
	- Since, the attack was performed inside a VPC so DNS logs are probably not used.
